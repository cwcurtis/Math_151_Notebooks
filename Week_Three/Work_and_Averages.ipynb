    "So, let's dabble in some physics.  Now, Newton is famous for saying few different things about *force*.  And what is force?  Well it's the thing that makes something that was at rest no longer at rest... among other things.  Mathematically, force, say $F$ is encapsulated in Newton's 2nd Law which says that \n",

    "So this problem is hard, because if you think about it, as I pull parts of the chain up onto the wall, the amount of mass I move decreases (assuming we let the parts we've pulled up to rest on the ground).  Right, there is just less chain to lift as I keep lifting it.  So to address this mathematically, I need to think, okay, now the mass is evenly distributed through the chain (not too unreasonable of an assumption).  So if \n",
